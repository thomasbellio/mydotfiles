# Profiles

Profiles are the core component of this zsh configuration. A profile consists of several modules that may be sourced in a given context.


Profiles are simple zsh files that calle the 'register_module' function defined in the [module-manager](../module-manager.zsh).

An example can be found in the [default profile](./default.zsh)
